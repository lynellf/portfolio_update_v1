# portfolio_update_v1 (Techdegree Project 1)

[Live Project is availabe Here](https://ezellfrazier.com/projects/portfoliov1)

## Project Overview

--------------------

-   Create or find an image file to represent yourself and a new image for the background. Be aware of file size: keep the profile image under  400 KB  and the background image under  1 MB(see the link in the project resources section to Picresize, an online image resizing tool).

````
<header class="index">
  <img src="images/ezell.jpg" alt="Image of Ezell Frazier." class="profile-image">
  <h1 class="tag name">Hello, Iâ€™m Ezell.</h1>
  <p class="tag location">Houston, Texas</p>
</header>
````

````
.portfolio {
  text-align: center;
  background: linear-gradient(#5c37ff, transparent 100%),
              linear-gradient(0deg, #f7f5f0, transparent 3%),
              url('images/code.PNG') no-repeat center ;

  background-size: cover;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding-top: 60px;
}
````

-   Using a text editor, modify the HTML of the index.html file:

-   Add the images you collected in step 1 to the page. Please leave the class "profile-image" intact on your profile image.

-   Don't forget to update the text for your new profile image's alt attribute!

-   Personalize all the text on the page by changing the name, background and goals. Feel free to make up the information if you do not wish to share anything personal.

<div class="card">
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>As a recent college graduate, I want to continue my life of learning and creating value for others. Joining the Treehouse
    Techdegree program feels like the right step after finishing with a bachelor's in management information systems.
    I'm super excited to be a part of this amazing experience.</p>
  <p>I have a strong background in computer hardware and customer service. However, it is time to set web development and programming as the track towards the future.</p>

-   Add links to your GitHub, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. If you don't have a Twitter or LinkedIn account, or don't want to share those, then you need to delete those links.

-   Edit the href value of the Home link so it navigates to  index.html. Note: do not use root relative links, or links that begin with a leading forward slash,  /.

        if (navi.style.display === "") {
            navi.style.display = "flex";
        } else {
            if (navi.style.display === "flex") {
                navi.style.display = "";
